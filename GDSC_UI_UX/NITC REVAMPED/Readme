# NIT Calicut Website Revamp

## Overview

## Why a Revamp Is Necessary (Hard Truth)

The current website suffers from **outdated design patterns, poor UX decisions, and weak information architecture**. These are not subjective opinions — they directly increase bounce rate, confusion, and mistrust.

A premier technical institute **cannot afford a website that feels like a decade-old government portal**.

## Current Problems in the Existing Site

### 1. Poor Information Architecture

**Problem:**

* Important content (Admissions, Academics, Placements, Departments) is buried inside deep menus
* Users must click 3–5 times to reach basic information
* No clear prioritization of what matters to different users

**Impact:**

* First-time visitors feel lost
* Applicants struggle to find admission-related content
* Recruiters waste time navigating cluttered pages

**Reality Check:**
If users need instructions to use your website, the design has already failed.

### 2. Outdated Visual Design

**Problem:**

* Inconsistent fonts, colors, and spacing
* No modern layout system (cards, grids, sections)
* Pages feel text-heavy and visually exhausting

**Impact:**

* Low credibility for an institute known for engineering excellence
* Poor first impression for international visitors
* Zero emotional connection with campus life



---




### 4. Navigation Is Overloaded

**Problem:**

* Too many links exposed at once
* Dropdown menus are cluttered and confusing
* No distinction between primary and secondary actions


More links ≠ more usability.

---

### 5. No Clear Visual Hierarchy

**Problem:**

* Headings, subheadings, and body text look similar
* Important announcements do not stand out
* No scannability


People scan websites. The current site forces them to read line-by-line.

---


* Heavy pages with unnecessary assets
* No lazy loading of images
* Inefficient structure

**Impact:**

* Slow load times on mobile data
* Poor user retention

**Truth:**
A slow site feels broken, even if it technically works.

---

### 8. No Storytelling or Identity

**Problem:**

* Campus life, fests, research, and achievements are poorly showcased
* No strong visual narrative

**Impact:**

* Missed opportunity to inspire applicants
* Website feels like a notice board, not an institution

**Observation:**
Great institutes tell stories. This site just dumps information.

---

## Objectives of the Revamp

* Simplify navigation
* Establish clear visual hierarchy
* Make the site mobile-first
* Improve performance
* Align design with a top-tier technical institute
* Showcase campus culture, events, and achievements

---

## Design Principles for the Revamped Site

* **Clarity over clutter**
* **Content-first design**
* **Mobile-first responsiveness**
* **Accessibility by default**
* **Modern, minimal UI**

---

## Target Users

* Prospective students
* Current students
* Faculty & staff
* Recruiters
* Alumni
* International visitors

Each group must find what they need **within seconds**, not minutes.
